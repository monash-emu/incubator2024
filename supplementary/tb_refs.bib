This study investigates the influence of treatment failure on tuberculosis control strategies, incorporating vaccination interventions using a deterministic compartmental epidemiological model. Mathematical analysis unveils disease-free and endemic equilibrium points, with the control reproduction number determined using next-generation methods. Identifying endemic equilibrium points and determining the control reproduction number provide essential metrics for assessing the effectiveness of control strategies and guiding policy decisions. The model exhibits a backward bifurcation phenomenon, leading to multiple endemic equilibria despite a reproduction number below one due to reinfection. Sensitivity analysis using Latin Hypercube Sampling/Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient elucidates parameter impacts on the control reproduction number. Vaccination efficacy is crucial for quality and validity, with superior quality and longer validity yielding more significant effects. While reinfection may not directly affect the reproduction number, its influence is pivotal in determining tuberculosis persistence or extinction. This study underscores the intricate interplay of factors in tuberculosis control strategies, providing insights vital for effective interventions and policy formulation.},

  abstract = {The importance of high-incidence ``hotspots'' to population-level tuberculosis (TB) incidence remains poorly understood. TB incidence varies widely across countries, but within smaller geographic areas (e.g., cities), TB transmission may be more homogeneous than other infectious diseases. We constructed a steady-state compartmental model of TB in Rio de Janeiro, replicating nine epidemiological variables (e.g., TB incidence) within 1\% of their observed values. We estimated the proportion of TB transmission originating from a high-incidence hotspot (6.0\% of the city's population, 16.5\% of TB incidence) and the relative impact of TB control measures targeting the hotspot vs. the general community. If each case of active TB in the hotspot caused 0.5 secondary transmissions in the general community for each within-hotspot transmission, the 6.0\% of people living in the hotspot accounted for 35.3\% of city-wide TB transmission. Reducing the TB transmission rate (i.e., number of secondary infections per infectious case) in the hotspot to that in the general community reduced city-wide TB incidence by 9.8\% in year 5, and 29.7\% in year 50---an effect similar to halving time to diagnosis for the remaining 94\% of the community. The importance of the hotspot to city-wide TB control depended strongly on the extent of TB transmission from the hotspot to the general community. High-incidence hotspots may play an important role in propagating TB epidemics. Achieving TB control targets in a hotspot containing 6\% of a city's population can have similar impact on city-wide TB incidence as achieving the same targets throughout the remaining community.},

  abstract = {Background GeneXpert is an effective and rapid molecular system used for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis. It is expected to improve the detection rate and treatment outcomes needed to meet the sustainable development goals (SDG) and End TB strategy targets set for 2030. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of GeneXpert on diagnosis and anti-TB treatment outcomes in the post-millennium development goals (MDGs) in the capital city of Ethiopia. Hence, the global priority indicator based on the End TB Strategy for TB treatment success rate was met early in 2018 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which was anticipated to be met by 2025. Methods A retrospective health facilities-based study was conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Records of all TB cases diagnosed and treated in selected health facilities from January 1st, 2015 to December 31st, 2018 were reviewed and included in the study. Data analysis of descriptive and inferential statistics was conducted using SPSS version 20. Results The reviewed records have shown that a total of 45,158 presumptive pulmonary TB (PTB) cases had accessed TB diagnosis services. Of which, 28.9\% (13072/45158) were tested by AFB microscopy and 71.1\% (32086/45158) were tested by GeneXpert. During the study period, the coverage of Xpert MTB/RIF testing increased to 94.9\% in 2018 compared to 1.6\% in 2015. The number of presumptive PTB cases tested with the GeneXpert system showed a significant increase compared to smear microscopy. The odds of positivity were detected in males compared to females. The odds of detecting TB cases were much higher among study participants aged 15--44 years compared to younger than 15 years. Treatment success rate showed a relative improvement each year between 2015 and 2018 with a mean of 92.6\%. Reduced odds of treatment successes were observed in age categories older than 35 years, and in TB/HIV co-infected patients. Increased odds of treatment successes were reported in the years between 2016 and 2018 compared to 2015. Conclusion Scaling up the Xpert MTB/RIF assay as a point-of-care test for presumptive TB cases in resource-limited settings would have a significant impact to meet the SDG and End TB strategy both in TB detection and treatment success rates.},

Symptomatic individuals were then tested using smear microscopy or GeneXpert MTB/RIF as first diagnostic test. Yield rates were compared for each intervention and diagnostic method. We evaluated additional cases notified from ACF interventions by comparing case notifications of the intervention and control districts using standard TB REACH methodology. The project identified 1092 TB cases. The highest yield was obtained from OPD screening at hospitals (n = 566/1092; 52\%). The proportion of positive tests using GeneXpert (5.5\%, n = 859/15,637) was significantly higher than from microscopy testing 2\% (n = 120/6309). (OR = 1.4; 95\%CI = 1.12--1.72; p = 0.0026). The project achieved 29\% additionality in case notifications in the intervention districts demonstrating that GeneXpert achieved substantially higher case-finding yields. Therefore, to increase national case notification for TB, Nepal should integrate OPD screening using GeneXpert testing in every district hospital and scale up of community-based ACF of TB patient contacts nationally.},

For instance, in Indonesia, a high TB burden country, TB case notifications decreased by 14\% and treatment coverage decreased by 47\% during COVID-19. We sought to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on TB case detection using two cross-sectional surveys conducted before (2018) and after the onset of the pandemic (2021). These surveys allowed us to quantify the delays that individuals with TB who eventually received treatment at private providers faced while trying to access care for their illness, their journey to obtain a diagnosis, the encounters individuals had with healthcare providers before a TB diagnosis, and the factors associated with patient delay and the total number of provider encounters. We found some worsening of care seeking pathways on multiple dimensions. Median patient delay increased from 28 days (IQR: 10, 31) to 32 days (IQR: 14, 90) and the median number of encounters increased from 5 (IQR: 4, 8) to 7 (IQR: 5, 10), but doctor and treatment delays remained relatively unchanged. Employed individuals experienced shorter delays compared to unemployed individuals (adjusted medians: -20.13, CI -39.14, -1.12) while individuals whose initial consult was in the private hospitals experienced less encounters compared to those visiting public providers, private primary care providers, and informal providers (-4.29 encounters, CI -6.76, -1.81). Patients who visited the healthcare providers {$>$}6 times experienced longer total delay compared to those with less than 6 visits (adjusted medians: 59.40, 95\% CI: 35.04, 83.77). Our findings suggest the need to ramp up awareness programs to reduce patient delay and strengthen private provide engagement in the country, particularly in the primary care sector.},

  abstract = {Introduction We conducted an implementation science study to increase TB case detection through a combination of interventions at health facility and community levels. We determined the impact of the study in terms of additional cases detected and notification rate and compared the yield of bacteriologically confirmed TB of facility based and community based case finding. Methodology Over a period of 18 months, similar case finding activities were conducted at George health facility in Lusaka Zambia and its catchment community, an informal peri-urban settlement. Activities included awareness and demand creation activities, TB screening with digital chest x-ray or symptom screening, sputum evaluation using geneXpert MTB/RIF, TB diagnosis and linkage to treatment. Results A total of 18,194 individuals were screened of which 9,846 (54.1\%) were screened at the facility and 8,348 (45.9\%) were screened in the community. The total number of TB cases diagnosed during the intervention period were 1,026, compared to 759 in the pre-intervention period; an additional 267 TB cases were diagnosed. Of the 563 bacteriologically confirmed TB cases diagnosed under the study, 515/563 (91.5\%) and 48/563 (8.5\%) were identified at the facility and in the community respectively (P{$<$}0.0001). The TB notification rate increased from 246 per 100,000 population pre-intervention to 395 per 100,000 population in the last year of the intervention. Conclusions Facility active case finding was more effective in detecting TB cases than community active case finding. Strengthening health systems to appropriately identify and evaluate patients for TB needs to be optimised in high burden settings. At a minimum, provider initiated TB symptom screening with completion of the TB screening and diagnostic cascade should be provided at the health facility in high burden settings. Community screening needs to be systematic and targeted at high risk groups and communities with access barriers.},

  abstract = {Background Tuberculosis (TB) remains significant public health issue in India, particularly in high-burden areas. Understanding factors associated with adverse treatment outcomes and delays in TB care pathway is crucial for improving TB control efforts. Hence, this study aimed to identify the determinants of delay in TB care pathway and adverse treatment outcomes in Chennai, South India. Methods We conducted retrospective cohort study among 497 newly diagnosed, drug-sensitive TB patients at ESIC Medical College \& PGIMSR, Chennai, from April 2020 to April 2022. Data were collected from the National TB Elimination Programme portal and supplemented via phone interviews. Patients were assessed for sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics, and delays in TB care cascade. Logistic regression models identified predictors of patient delay, total delay, non-adherence, and adverse treatment outcomes and interpreted as adjusted odds ratio (AOR). Results The study found median patient delay of 18 days and total delay of 28 days in TB care pathway. Females and patients without fever at baseline had significantly longer delays. Extrapulmonary TB was associated with longer total delay. Non-adherence to medication was prevalent (26.6~\%) and was the strongest predictor of adverse treatment outcomes (AOR:39.18, 95 \%CI: 21.56--71.20, p~{$<~$}0.001). Conclusion Our study found significant delays in care-seeking, especially among females and individuals without fever at baseline. Non-adherence to treatment was prevalent and associated with adverse treatment outcomes. Implementation of community-based adherence support programs that include regular patient follow-ups and counseling sessions will address barriers to treatment adherence, especially tailored for women and individuals with extrapulmonary TB.},

  abstract = {Background Undernutrition is a major risk factor for TB incidence in the WHO South-East (SE) Asia Region. We examined the potential impact of addressing undernutrition as a preventive measure, for reducing TB burden in region. Methods We developed a deterministic, compartmental mathematical model, capturing undernutrition and its associated excess risk of TB, amongst countries in the Region. We simulated two types of interventions: (i) nutritional rehabilitation amongst all close contacts of TB patients, and (ii) an illustrative, population-wide scenario where 30\% of people with undernutrition would be nutritionally rehabilitated each year. We also simulated this impact with additional measures to improve the TB care cascade. Findings The impact of nutritional interventions varies by country. For example, in India nutritional rehabilitation of 30\% of undernourished population each year would avert 15.9\% (95\% Uncertainty Intervals (UI) 11.8--21.3) of cumulative incidence between 2023 and 2030, contrasting with 4.8\% (95\% UI 2.9--9.5) for Bhutan, which has only 10.9\% prevalence of undernutrition. Reductions in cumulative mortality range from 11.6\% (95\% UI 8.2--17.1) for Bhutan, to 26.0\% (95\% UI 22.4--30.8) for India. Comparable incremental reductions in TB burden arise when combined with measures to improve the TB care cascade. Overall, nutritional interventions in the general population would increase incidence reductions by 2--3 fold, and mortality reductions by 5--6 fold, relative to targeting only contacts. Interpretation Nutritional interventions could cause substantial reductions in TB burden in the Region. Their health benefits extend well beyond TB, underlining their importance for public health.

Despite the importance of these decisions, there is currently no mechanism to review and confirm the appropriateness of modelling analyses. We have developed a benchmarking, reporting, and review (BRR) approach and accompanying tools to allow constructive review of country-level TB modelling applications. This approach has been piloted in five modelling applications and the results of this study have been used to revise and finalise the approach. The BRR approach consists of 1) quantitative benchmarks against which model assumptions and results can be compared, 2) standardised reporting templates and review criteria, and 3) a multi-stage review process providing feedback to modellers during the application, as well as a summary evaluation after completion. During the pilot, use of the tools prompted important changes in the approaches taken to modelling. The pilot also identified issues beyond the scope of a review mechanism, such as a lack of empirical evidence and capacity constraints. This approach provides independent evaluation of the appropriateness of modelling decisions during the course of an application, allowing meaningful changes to be made before results are used to inform decision-making. The use of these tools can improve the quality and transparency of country-level TB modelling applications.},

These packages can support infectious disease modelling to be more robust, efficient and transparent, which has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a package for the construction of infectious disease models, integrated it with several open-source libraries and applied this composite pipeline to multiple data sources that provided insights into Australia's 2022 COVID-19 epidemic. We aimed to identify the key processes relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics and thereby develop a model that could quantify relevant epidemiological parameters. The pipeline's advantages include markedly increased speed, an expressive application programming interface, the transparency of open-source development, easy access to a broad range of calibration and optimisation tools and consideration of the full workflow from input manipulation through to algorithmic generation of the publication materials. Extending the base model to include mobility effects slightly improved model fit to data, with this approach selected as the model configuration for further epidemiological inference. Under our assumption of widespread immunity against severe outcomes from recent vaccination, incorporating an additional effect of the main vaccination programs rolled out during 2022 on transmission did not further improve model fit. Our simulations suggested that one in every two to six COVID-19 episodes were detected, subsequently emerging Omicron subvariants escaped 30--60\% of recently acquired natural immunity and that natural immunity lasted only one to eight months on average. We documented our analyses algorithmically and present our methods in conjunction with interactive online code notebooks and plots. We demonstrate the feasibility of integrating a flexible domain-specific syntax library with state-of-the-art packages in high performance computing, calibration, optimisation and visualisation to create an end-to-end pipeline for infectious disease modelling. We used the resulting platform to demonstrate key epidemiological characteristics of the transition from the emergency to the endemic phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.},
