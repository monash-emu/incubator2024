The eight parameter sets with the highest post-optimization log-likelihood were selected as starting points for eight parallel Markov chains in the DEMetropolisZ sampler. This proceeded for 10,000 tuning cycles and 25,000 sampling cycles. After calibration, we generated 95% credible intervals by running the model with 2,000 parameter sets from accepted samples of the calibration phase. Each model candidate completed 8 chains of 35,000 iterations per chain within 8 hours on a computer with an 8-core Apple M1 processor and 16 GB of RAM.

Scenario 2 is a combination of increasing Xpert utilisation to 95%, 95% TSR, and 5-fold treatment initiation rate by 2027, and annual ACF implementation in 60% of population . Coloured solid lines represent different intervention combinations as described in the legend. Shaded areas show interquartile ranges (dark) and 95% credible intervals (light). Black points indicate the national TB elimination  targets for TB incidence and red points represent the 2035 End TB targets for incidence and mortality. \"\n",
