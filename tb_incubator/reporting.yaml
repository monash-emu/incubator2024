introduction: |
  Indonesia is ranked as the second highest tuberculosis (TB) burden in the world [@whotb2023]. According to the most recent Global TB Report, TB incidence in Indonesia increased by 18% in 2022 compared to 2015. TB prevalence was estimated during the 2013-2014 national TB prevalence survey. It is reported that the TB prevalence estimate was 759 (95% CI 590-961) smear-positive, bacteriologically-confirmed infections per 100,000 population in people aged over 15 years [@indoprevsurv2015]. This estimate provides additional insights regarding the underreporting of TB cases.
 
  Indonesia has committed to eliminating TB by 2030. To achieve this goal, the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the National TB Control Programme (NTCP) have developed six strategic plans for 2020â€“2024. Modelling can be a powerful tool to support these plans by providing epidemiological insights into TB dynamics and control, and by helping optimise strategies through projections of future trends based on current efforts [@trauer2016]. However, our preliminary survey revealed that very few TB models, particularly those for programme evaluation purposes, have been developed for Indonesia.
 
  The Epidemiological Modelling Unit at Monash University has developed software to create a TB transmission model. This tool is based on the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartmental model framework. Models for several countries have already been developed to assess the impact of interventions by local TB control programmes [@ragonnet2022, @ragonnet2019, @doan2019, @trauer2016].

  @fig-notif illustrates TB case notifications in Indonesia in 2000-2022 [@whotb2023]. The notification began to rise in 2016 until 2018, followed by a slight reduction in 2019 and significant drop in 2020. The trend then starts to increase again in 2021, followed by a dramatic increase in 2022. Here we assume that the rise in TB notifications in 2016 may be attributed to improvements in the TB detection programme, alongside the implementation of active case finding (ACF) in 2018-2019 [@moh2020]. The decline in notifications in 2020 may also be related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic [@surendra2023]. We aim to capture these dynamics, particularly over the last decade, where improved programmatic interventions have been implemented.


result-compartment: |
  @fig-compsize illustrates the size of each compartment in our base model and percentage of latently infected individuals. The model fits with the demographic trends from the UN population estimates [@unwpp2024] and national census data [@indostatistics2020]. The model predicts that epidemics will occur between 1910 and 1920, as the number of susceptible individuals decreases, while the number of individuals in the late latent stage of TB infection increases. As the population grows exponentially, the number of susceptible individuals begins to rise again in the 1950s, with a continued increase in the late latent compartment. We also calculated the percentage of people with latent TB by dividing the sum of people in the early latent and late latent compartments by the total population.

result-notifprev: |
  The results of our baseline calibration are shown in @fig-notifprev, where the model was fitted to local TB epidemiology data, particularly data for case notifications and prevalence. This demonstrates that the baseline model can capture the general dynamics from 2000 to 2020 and aligns well with the prevalence data from the 2013-2014 survey. 

result-conclusion: |
  We believe that further improvements can be made to the model, and obtaining more reliable data will help us better capture overall trends. Once we establish the baseline epidemic, we can investigate counterfactual scenarios by introducing or removing interventions. This approach will allow us to evaluate their effectiveness and potential impact.
